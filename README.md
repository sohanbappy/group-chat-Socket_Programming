#Rocking Socket(Java)

I've used:

#Architecture : Client-Server

#Version Control System : Git

#Editor : NetBeans


In this Project, I've tried to develop Multi-User Chatting(concurrent) App using Java

Rules:

#Open Project and Run Server(one) and Client/s(one or more)

#In Client, Enter room_name and then connect

#type in the editor and then click on Send

#to leave the room--> press logout

I've used NetBeans to run single frame separately (easily)

N.B: if GUI is not visible clearly then hide that frame and again focus on that frame
